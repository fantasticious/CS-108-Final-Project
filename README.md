# CS-108-Final-Project
For our final project, I created a game called Hancom Typing Game. When the game runs, words will fall from the Gui canvas, and the goal of the user is to type the corresponding words. When the user successfully types a falling word, the word will be deleted from the canvas. However, if the word reaches down to the red line on the screen before the user types the word, the user will lose a life. The user starts with three lives and the goal is to type as many words as possible before losing three lives. When the user successfully writes a word, the user will gain one point.
